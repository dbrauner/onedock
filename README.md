# ONEDock
This project intends to provide support for OpenNebula to create Docker containers and deliver them to the end user as if they were Virtual Machines.

## What is ONEDock?
ONEDock is a set of extensions for [OpenNebula](http://www.opennebula.org/) to use containers as if they were virtual machines (VM).

The concept of ONEDock is to configure Docker to act as an hypervisor. It behaves just as KVM does in the context of OpenNebula.

# Assumptions
For a proper OneDock installation you need the following:

* A Linux installation with [OpenNebula](http://www.opennebula.org) on it.
 * [Ubuntu 14.04 and KVM](http://docs.opennebula.org/4.14/design_and_installation/quick_starts/qs_ubuntu_kvm.html)
 * [CentOS 7 and KVM](http://docs.opennebula.org/4.14/design_and_installation/quick_starts/qs_centos7_kvm.html)
* A local Docker registry v2.0 installed in a host (named dockerregistry), which is the same ONE frontend.
* The folder in which the docker images are stored is known and it is accessible from the command line.

If you do not have such deployment please follow the instruction of section <a href="#quick">_Quick deployment of a test environment_</a>.
